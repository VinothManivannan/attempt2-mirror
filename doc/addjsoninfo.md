addjsoninfo is a tahini method added to allow additional regmap information to be added to the input json file generated by tahini gimli. This will typically include access (e.g. none for padding registers or making registers public instead of default private), briefs (to add descriptions), cref (to replace buffer with registers) or cmap_name (to replace name in regmap), though it allows other fields to be added too.

It was created to add additional fields to the Rumba S10 regmap as the source code is not maintained by CML. 

The input json file consists of regmap and enums. Given the method uses InputJson as objects, there are restrictions in terms of fields:
•	Regmap: InputRegmap, so type and name are mandatory
•	Enums: InputEnum, so name and value or name and enumerators are mandatory
•	Empty regmap/enums/struct/enum: given the restrictions above, these will need to have dummy values which will be ignored (see below)

Empty json file example:

{
    "regmap": [
        {
            "type": "unsigned char",
            "name": "None"
        }
    ],
    "enums": [
        {
            "name": "None",
            "enumerators": [
                {
                    "name": "None",
                    "value": 0
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
